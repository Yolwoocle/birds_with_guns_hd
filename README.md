# Birds With Guns HD
Made using [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/). Remake/Sequel of [Birds With Guns](https://yolwoocle.itch.io/birds-with-guns).

**NOTE:** If you are here to look for well-structured code, and to learn from others, then this is NOT the right place. 
If your intent is so, a much better example could be basically any other LÖVE game, like these random games I pulled on itch.io: 
- [Curse Of The Arrow](https://github.com/egordorichev/CurseOfTheArrow), 
- [Labyrinth of Legendary Loot](https://dominaxis-games.itch.io/labyrinth-of-legendary-loot). Rename the .love to .zip, and decompress it.
